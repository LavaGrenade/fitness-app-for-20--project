For the week of February first to February fith. Tyler and I worked on and completed the app feature list, which contains the different workouts, the different functions, and settings for the app.  I also started the creation of the app in android studio.  However, none of the coding was actually completed.  I also researched how to install and use android studio including the subjects of creating an app, coding an app, and running the app on a virtual machine.  We also came up with some alternate features including a time exclusion feature, and possibly a step counter.  I installed the java SDK in order to properly run android studio and create the app.  Tyler mainly worked on the workouts and different muscle group organization.  During this week I installed git bash for my computer and learned somewhat how to use it.  I still need help working it. two more
