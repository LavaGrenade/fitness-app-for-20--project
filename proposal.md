## Needs and Opportunities
Some executives at Au-Si Industries have been getting slightly overweight and due to our broken elevator, they have to go up the stairs.  By the time they get to their office they are all out of breath and need a 30 minute nap on company time.  With this app we can help them, and the world, be a healthier and happier place.  Not only that, the app can be customized by the user to work out only what they need or want.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone who wants to get fit while having a great time will benefit from this app.  Contrary to some beliefs 30 Seconds of Mayhem is not only for people wanting to watch their weight, but for everyone who wants to lead a happier life.  Research shows people who are more active are generally more happy.  This expands our clientell base to anyone who wants to be happy.  Research also show that people who want to be happy are everywhere.  This makes it convenient for finding the target client base of our app.

## Product
30 Seconds of Mayhem is a semi customizable app that helps people work on being fit or keeping fit.
What is the actual product you will show this spring. This project may be made
of atoms or bits, but you must have something to show. I'm not interested
seeing a bunch of great ideas at the end of the year. I want to see things.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that\u2019s
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable                                    				    |
| ------------- | -------------                                   					|
| February 26   | Feature list, learned how to use android studio  					|
| April 1       | Have app UI done                         					|
| April 29      | Have app fully ready, minor things such as asthetics still needed |

## Reality Check
Should Au-Si Industries decide to put it on the app store we will need $25 to do so.  We plan to make this money by telling our parents we need it for school.
I am looking for moonshots here, but even moonshots need budgets. What
equipment are you going to need? What other capital expenditures do you
anticipate, and how will you meet them?

## Conclusion
We here at Au-Si Industries are very excited about 30 Seconds of Mayhem.  It is a fully customizable app that lets you choose your workout and helps you achieve your goal at random times throughout the day.  30 Seconds of Mayhem is a fun way to get fit and can improve your social confidence.  We believe that this app will solve childhood obesity.  The goal of this project is to make itself virtually useless.  Support fitness and help 30 Seconds of Mayhem become great.
