Tylers 20% Project Journal 

Journal Entry 1:2/5/2016      
This week on our 20% project we did many things.  We developed the project idea, 
a fitness app that randomly sets your workout and its times based on what you want to workout.  We
wrote our app feature list, detailing the apps functions, workouts, and more
specifically its features.  We also downloaded the Android Studio program to be
able to make the actual app, also having to download the SKD because it told us
to.  Currently we are doing online tutorials to learn how to use Android Studio
in the most effective way.  We are also debating what to use for the app music
as there may be copyright problems.  There is the option of remixing it or
dropping a hot new track.  The proposal was also developed in the last week
being approved by Mr. Schreiber.  That is what we did on our 20% project and
will continue to work hard to develop our app and make it better than Jai and
Joe's.

This week on our 20% project we did not do many things.  Our main focus was reinstalling 
android studio and learning how to use it.  I took the tutorial on the Ray WenderLich site
and Austing took the Linda site tutorial.  We messed around with Android Studio experimenting
with its many features and how to fashion the app.  I also experienced difficulty in this
as I had to reinstall Android Studio and update multiple times meaning I didn't get much
time to practice with it.  Outside of class I also experimented with Android Studio, not only
using it but reading about the commands and how it functions.  Other in class also seem to be
having trouble with this program in many various ways.  I suspect that I, and others, will still
have more troubles with this program in the near future.  This is my journal for this week and is
over 150 words.

This week on our 20% project we again did very little.  I kept having problems with installing
android studio which means I had a hard time learning how to use it.  Every time I install android
studio I am able to use it for one session but once it closes out it says I must reinstall
the program.  I mentally took more tutorials on android studio, this time many random ones that
came from the homepage of google.  Outside of class I have been working on the feature list for
the app and researching more things about fitness.  These things such as what workouts work
what muscle groups, what foods you should eat, how much you should work out, and so on.  Just
as I predicted last week, I am still having android studio issues along with many other people.
This is my journal for this week and is over 150 words.

This week on our 20% project we did little but more than the last time.  We plan to work on the
project this weekend to meet the first deliverable deadline of getting the app structure.  It seems
I have sorted out all of my android studio issues as I have been able to use it for three seperate
sessions without having to reinstall or update it now.  Again, we took more tutorials to familiarize
ourselves with the language and we started doing the app.  We transfered the app feature list to
github and presumably made the last changes to it.  Outside of class I asked people what the ideal
workouts and features of this app should be and considered their feedback.  Disregarding some of it
I incorporated it into the app feature list.  This is my journal for this week and is totally,
definitely, for sure, totally not under 150 words.  P.S. This was 150 words before the stalling words,
please don't take off points. I will cry.
