Tylers 20% Project Journal Journal Entry 1:2/5/2016      This week on our 20%
project we did many things.  We developed the project idea, a fitness app that
randomly sets your workout and its times based on what you want to workout.  We
wrote our app feature list, detailing the apps functions, workouts, and more
specifically its features.  We also downloaded the Android Studio program to be
able to make the actual app, also having to download the SKD because it told us
to.  Currently we are doing online tutorials to learn how to use Android Studio
in the most effective way.  We are also debating what to use for the app music
as there may be copyright problems.  There is the option of remixing it or
dropping a hot new track.  The proposal was also developed in the last week
being approved by Mr. Schreiber.  That is what we did on our 20% project and
will continue to work hard to develop our app and make it better than Jai and
Joe's.
