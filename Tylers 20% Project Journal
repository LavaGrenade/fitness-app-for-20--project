Tylers 20% Project Journal 

Journal Entry 1:2/5/2016      
This week on our 20% project we did many things.  We developed the project idea, 
a fitness app that randomly sets your workout and its times based on what you want to workout.  We
wrote our app feature list, detailing the apps functions, workouts, and more
specifically its features.  We also downloaded the Android Studio program to be
able to make the actual app, also having to download the SKD because it told us
to.  Currently we are doing online tutorials to learn how to use Android Studio
in the most effective way.  We are also debating what to use for the app music
as there may be copyright problems.  There is the option of remixing it or
dropping a hot new track.  The proposal was also developed in the last week
being approved by Mr. Schreiber.  That is what we did on our 20% project and
will continue to work hard to develop our app and make it better than Jai and
Joe's.

Journal Entry 2:2/14/2016
This week on our 20% project we did not do many things.  Our main focus was reinstalling 
android studio and learning how to use it.  I took the tutorial on the Ray WenderLich site
and Austing took the Linda site tutorial.  We messed around with Android Studio experimenting
with its many features and how to fashion the app.  I also experienced difficulty in this
as I had to reinstall Android Studio and update multiple times meaning I didn't get much
time to practice with it.  Outside of class I also experimented with Android Studio, not only
using it but reading about the commands and how it functions.  Other in class also seem to be
having trouble with this program in many various ways.  I suspect that I, and others, will still
have more troubles with this program in the near future.  This is my journal for this week and is
over 150 words.
